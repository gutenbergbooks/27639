<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><big style="font-variant: small-caps;">There</big> are already a good many vegetarian cookery
books, ranging in price from one penny to half-a-crown,
but yet, when I am asked, as not unfrequently
happens, to recommend such a book, I
know of only one which at all fulfils the requirements,
and even that one is, I find, rather severely
criticised by ladies who know anything about the
matter.</p>

<p>To have to live by some of them would almost
make a vegetarian turn meat-eater. Most are compilations
from other books with the meat dishes
left out, and a little porridge and a few beans
and peas thrown in. All of them, I believe, contain
a lot of puddings and sweets, which certainly
are vegetarian, but which can be found in any
ordinary cookery book.</p>

<p>What is required is a book that will enable us
to provide something to take the place of meat,
which, while nourishing, shall at the same time be
palatable. This the present book aims at doing.
Of the 221 recipes given, upwards of 200 are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi">vi</a></span>absolutely original, having been carefully thought
out and tested by the author herself, and not hitherto
published anywhere. Many of them are as nourishing,
weight for weight, as ordinary dishes made with
meat, those containing beans, peas, eggs, and the
various sorts of grain, being the most nourishing.
If they are not all found to be palatable, the fault
must be in the individual cook, who cannot have
put in the important ingredient of <em>feeling</em>, without
which no work can be wholly good.</p>

<p>The thorough-going vegetarian, to whom abstinence
from meat is part of his ethical code and his
religion,&mdash;who would as soon think of taking his
neighbour's purse as helping himself to a slice of
beef,&mdash;is by nature a man of frugal habits and
simple tastes. He <em>prefers</em> a plain diet, and knows
that the purest enjoyment is to be found in fruits
of all kinds as nature supplies them. He needs
but little cookery, and that of the simplest. To him
this book will be of little use, except when he wishes
to entertain his friends.</p>

<p>But there are others who, while not feeling that
any moral principle is immediately involved in the
matter of diet, yet would like to be relieved from
the necessity of eating flesh, possibly on Ã¦sthetic
grounds, or it may be from hygienic reasons, or in
some cases, I hope, because they would willingly
diminish the sufferings involved in the transport
and slaughter of animals, inevitable as long as they
are used for food. To these it is hoped that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii">vii</a></span>little book may act as an encouragement and
help.</p>

<p>Nor need our carnivorous friends be afraid of it.
A good deal of nonsense is talked (by meat-eaters
I mean, of course) about the properties of food, and
they would have us believe that they eat a beef-steak
mainly because it contains 21.5 per cent. of
nitrogen. But we know better. They have eaten
steaks for many years, but it was only last week, in
working up for a debate, that they found out about
the nitrogen. It is not the chemical ingredients
which determine the diet, but the <em>flavour</em>; and it is
quite remarkable, when some tasty vegetarian dishes
are on the table, how soon the percentages of nitrogen
are forgotten, and how far a small piece of
meat will go. If this little book shall succeed in thus
weaning away a few from a custom which is bad&mdash;bad
for the suffering creatures that are butchered&mdash;bad
for the class set apart to be the slaughterers&mdash;bad
for the consumers physically, in that it produces
disease, and morally, in that it tends to feed
the lower and more ferocious qualities of mind, and
also for ever prevents our treating the animal
creation with that <em>courtesy</em> (as Sir Arthur Helps
put it) which is their due&mdash;then I know that it
will not have wholly failed in carrying out the
author's benevolent intention.</p>

VEGETARIAN DISHES.</p>




<h2 class="new-h2" style="page-break-before: auto;"><a name="General_Hints">GENERAL HINTS.</a></h2>


<h3 class="new-h3">Haricot Beans.</h3>

<p>Among the pulses there is none more nourishing,
more generally liked, nor more useful to the vegetarian
cook than the haricot bean. Whether on
account of its refined flavour, its delicate colour,
its size, or last, but not least, its cheapness, I do
not hesitate to place it first. Like the potato,
however, its very simplicity lays it open to careless
treatment, and many who would be the first to
appreciate its good qualities if it were placed
before them well cooked and served, now recoil
from the idea of habitually feeding off what they
know only under the guise of a stodgy, insipid, or
watery mass. A few hints, therefore, respecting
the best manner of preparing this vegetable may be
useful.</p>

<p>Firstly, the beans should invariably be washed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>and placed in a basin of cold water the night before
they are required for use, and should remain in soak
about ten or twelve hours. If left longer than this
during hot weather they are apt to turn sour.</p>

<p>They should not be cooked in the same water
that they have been soaked in.</p>

<p>Soft water must be used to cook them. If this
be not obtainable, Maignen's Ante-Calcaire will be
found to render the water soft.</p>

<p>Salt should not be added until they are at least
half cooked, as its tendency is to harden them.
This applies also to peas, lentils, etc.</p>

<p>They take about two hours to cook, or three if
required very soft.</p>

<p>They must not be allowed to boil very fast, for,
like potatoes, they are then liable to break before
becoming tender.</p>

<p>About two pints of water, one ounce of butter,
and one teaspoon of salt to half-pint of soaked
beans, may be taken as a fair average.</p>

<p>During soaking they swell to nearly double their
original size, and in boiling they double again.</p>

<p>Never throw away the liquor in which they are
boiled but reserve it as &ldquo;stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they are to be plainly served as a vegetable,
it is best to remove the lid of the saucepan
a few minutes before dishing up, and so reduce
the liquor to the desired strength.</p>

<p>When required for frying they should be strained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>as soon as tender, and spread over a plate to dry.
They may then be fried in butter or oil.</p>

<p>Always make a point of tasting them before
sending to table, for if not sufficiently salted they
are very insipid.</p>

<p>All spices, herbs, etc., boiled with the beans for
flavouring purposes, should be tied in a small piece
of muslin, which may at any moment be easily
removed.</p>

<p>Haricot bean pulp, which will be found frequently
mentioned in the following recipes, is made by
boiling the beans until tender and rather dry, and
then rubbing them through a wire sieve with a
wooden spoon.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3">Lentils.</h3>

<p>Next in usefulness to the haricot bean comes the
German lentil. This must not be confounded with
the Egyptian lentil, which closely resembles the split
pea; for not only is the former double the price of
the latter, but I may add double its worth also, at
least from a culinary point of view.</p>

<p>In vegetarian cookery the lentil takes the place
of the dark meats of the flesh-eaters' dietary, such
as beef and mutton, the haricot bean supplying a
substitute for the white, such as veal, chicken, etc.</p>

<p>The liquor in which lentils have been boiled forms
a rich foundation for dark sauces, also a delicious and
nourishing beverage, in flavour resembling beef-tea,
can be obtained from them (see <a href="#Recipe_12">Recipe No.&nbsp;12</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>
Besides being darker in colour, the flavour of
lentils is much more pronounced than that of
haricots.</p>

<p>Throughout the following recipes the word
&ldquo;lentil&rdquo; means German lentil, without exception.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3">Split Peas, etc.</h3>

<p>Most of the advice given above respecting haricots
and lentils applies to the treatment of split
peas, dried green peas, and Egyptian lentils.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3">Thickenings for Soups and Sauce.</h3>

<p>Pearl barley is invaluable for thickening soups,
sauces, etc.</p>

<p>It should be strained away when the required
consistency is obtained, for if left in too long the
flavour is apt to be found a little too strong for
some tastes.</p>

<p>Sago, tapioca, rice, and semolina are all useful for
thickening, and it is generally advisable to strain
the sauces in which they are used, before sending to
table.</p>

<p>If paste of flour and butter be used for thickening,
there will be no necessity to use a strainer,
unless the sauce becomes lumpy. This can generally
be remedied, however, by prolonged stirring
over the fire.</p>

<p>The paste is made by placing equal quantities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>flour and butter on a plate, and working them
together with a knife until the flour is thoroughly
incorporated.</p>

<p>Use about one ounce each of flour and butter to
one pint of sauce, or to two pints of soup.</p>

<p>For thickening dark sauces, stews, etc., flour
which has been baked in the oven until it has
turned a very light brown will be found better
than white flour. If allowed to become too brown
it will acquire a disagreeable flavour.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3">Frying in Oil.</h3>

<p>A medium-sized iron saucepan and a wire basket
to fit it easily should be kept for this purpose. Fill
about a third of the saucepan with oil (be quite
sure that the quality is good), put in the wire
basket, and place the saucepan over the fire or gas,
and after a few minutes watch it carefully to see
when it begins to boil. This will be notified by the
oil becoming quite still, and emitting a thin blue
vapour. Directly this is observed, drop the articles
to be fried gently into the basket, taking care not
to overcrowd them, or their shape will be quite
spoiled. When they have become a golden brown,
lift out the basket, suspend it for one moment over
the saucepan to allow the oil to run back, then
carefully turn the fritters on to some soft paper, and
serve piled on a hot dish, not forgetting to use a
fish paper.</p>

<p>When cold, the oil should be strained through a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>fine strainer, lined with a piece of muslin. It is
then ready for use again with a little more added.</p>

<p>Should the oil become burnt, it must of course be
thrown away.</p>


<h3 class="new-h3">Bread Crumbs.</h3>

<p>To procure <em>fine</em> bread crumbs, rub stale bread
through a wire sieve. For this the hands should be
scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>Should the crumbs be required <em>coarse</em>, rubbing
the bread on a grater will answer the purpose.</p>

<h2>RECIPES.</h2>



<h3 class="new-h3">SOUPS.</h3>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_1">No.&nbsp;1.</a>&mdash;Artichoke Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>3&nbsp;pounds Jerusalem artichokes after peeling.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;pints water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pint milk.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;ounces butter.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;teaspoons salt.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;shalots.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;teaspoons chopped celery.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;tablespoon sago.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen peppercorns, with a suspicion of mace and cinnamon tied in muslin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel the artichokes and throw them into cold
water. Dissolve the butter in a large enamelled
saucepan, slice the artichokes and fry for five
minutes in the butter, then add the water, shalots
and celery chopped, and the seasonings. Boil for
three-quarters of an hour, removing the scum as it
rises. Add milk and sago, and stir frequently for
twenty minutes. Rub through a hair sieve into a
tureen.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Cream is often recommended for this
soup, but when sago and milk are used as above,
the result will be found extremely satisfactory,
and the expense considerably lessened.</p>


<div class="new-h4">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<h4><a name="Recipe_2">No.&nbsp;2.</a>&mdash;Asparagus Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>60&nbsp;heads of asparagus.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;cabbage lettuce.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;quarts of water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce of butter.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;medium-sized onions.</li>
<li>A sprig of mint.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;tablespoon of sago.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;teaspoons of salt.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;teaspoon of pepper.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;or 3 drops of spinach extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the butter in a large saucepan, place
in the lettuce finely shredded, the salt, pepper,
mint, onions sliced, water, and the green portion of
the asparagus, but reserving thirty tops. Boil one
hour. Stir in the sago and boil again, stirring
frequently for half an hour without the lid. Boil
the thirty tops separately in a little salted water
until tender. Strain the soup through a hair sieve
(rubbing the pulp through with a wooden spoon)
into a hot tureen, add the tops and the colouring,
and serve.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;If the soup be made some time before
required, do not cook the tops until it is being
re-heated.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_3">No.&nbsp;3.</a>&mdash;Brown Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>6&nbsp;cold boiled potatoes.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;onions stuck with cloves.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;tomato.</li>
<li>2Â½&nbsp;pints stock.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;ounces butter.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;strip of lemon peel.</li>
<li>3&nbsp;whole allspice.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen peppercorns.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;teaspoon Worcester sauce.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen <a href="#Recipe_78">forcemeat balls, No.&nbsp;78</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the potatoes and fry them very carefully in
the butter, so as to thoroughly brown without burning
them. Place them in a saucepan with the stock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>and simmer five minutes; by this time the brown
colour will have boiled off the potatoes into the
soup. Strain away the potatoes, return the soup
to the saucepan, add onions (each stuck with three
cloves), lemon peel, sauce, spices, pepper and salt,
and the tomato sliced and fried. Simmer one
hour, strain into a hot tureen, place in the forcemeat
balls, which have been previously fried, and
serve quickly.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_4">No.&nbsp;4.</a>&mdash;Carrot Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pint haricot beans.</li>
<li>5&nbsp;pints water.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;ounces butter.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce salt.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;large carrots.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;large onions.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;small head of celery.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;teaspoon peppercorns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the butter in a large saucepan. Slice
the vegetables, and place them in the saucepan
together with the water and peppercorns, and simmer
for one hour. Add salt, and simmer for another
hour and a half. Strain.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_5">No.&nbsp;5.</a>&mdash;Celery Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>3&nbsp;large heads of celery.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;large onion.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;potato.</li>
<li>3&nbsp;pints water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen peppercorns.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;ounces butter.</li>
<li>Â¾&nbsp;ounce flour.</li>
<li>1Â½&nbsp;teaspoons salt.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;pint milk.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pinch of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve one ounce of butter in a good-sized
saucepan, then add the vegetables sliced, and all
the other ingredients, except flour, milk, and the
other ounce of butter. Simmer for one and a half
hours. Strain, thicken with flour and butter. Add
milk, and serve very hot.</p>


<div class="new-h4">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span></p>
<h4><a name="Recipe_6">No.&nbsp;6.</a>&mdash;Chestnut Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pound chestnuts.</li>
<li>1Â½&nbsp;pints water.</li>
<li>Yolk of one egg, or 1 teaspoon cream.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;onion.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;small turnip.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;peppercorns, and a very small pinch of mixed herbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the chestnuts for half an hour. In the
meantime dissolve the butter in a stewpan; then
fry in it the onion and turnip sliced, add the water
flavourings, and chestnuts after removing the shells
and skins. Boil one hour. Place the cream or
yolk in a basin, strain the soup on to it and stir,
then strain it back into the saucepan; re-warm, but
do not allow to boil. Pour into the tureen and
serve.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_7">No.&nbsp;7.</a>&mdash;French Bean Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>3&nbsp;pints water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pint soaked haricot beans.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;potatoes.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;onion.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pound French beans.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen peppercorns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the butter in a saucepan and fry in it
the potatoes and onion sliced for five minutes,
then add the haricot beans and water and boil for
two hours. Add the salt, rub through a wire sieve,
replace in the pan, add the French beans cut fine,
and simmer until tender. Tinned beans do equally
well, and only require to be made thoroughly hot.</p>


<div class="new-h4">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span></p>
<h4><a name="Recipe_8">No.&nbsp;8.</a>&mdash;Green Kale Soup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>2&nbsp;pounds green kale.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;onion.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;Spanish ditto.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;potatoes.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;teaspoons sago.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;quart water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;dozen peppercorns, and a suspicion each of mace and sweet herbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the butter in a saucepan, and place in
it the onions and potatoes sliced; then add water,
salt and flavourings, and boil for one hour. In
the meantime prepare the kale by picking off all
but the tender middle shoots, trim the stalks and

<ul class="ingredients"><li>Â¼&nbsp;pound flour.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;ounces butter.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Â¼&nbsp;pound cooked lentils and vegetables mixed.</li>

<li>Â½&nbsp;teaspoon pepper.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;teaspoons flour.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;tablespoons vinegar.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;tablespoon water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel the beetroot, and cut into slices about a
quarter of an inch thick. Dissolve the butter in
a frying pan, place in the beetroot and fry for
twenty minutes, sprinkling each slice on both sides
with the pepper and salt. When done, arrange the
slices on a hot dish. Reset the frying pan on the
fire, stir in the flour, thoroughly mixing it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81">81</a></span>the butter, and fry for a couple of minutes, stirring

<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_145">No.&nbsp;145.</a>&mdash;Brussels Sprouts.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>Sprouts.</li>
<li>Salted water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clean the sprouts <em>very thoroughly</em>, removing all
the decayed and outside leaves, and when perfectly
free from dirt and insects, place them in
plenty of fast-boiling salted water, and boil for
about twenty minutes, or until quite tender but not
broken. Keep the lid off all the time they are
cooking, remove the scum as it rises, and be sure
and use <em>no</em> soda. When they are tender, have ready
a colander with a cloth laid in it, lift the sprouts
out with an egg slice, and lay them carefully on
the cloth to drain, place about a dozen of the best
shaped ones on a hot plate or dish, slide the
remainder gently off the cloth on to a hot drainer
in a vegetable dish, and arrange the reserved ones
on the top.</p>

<p>Sprouts are often spoiled in the dishing up, but
no vegetable looks and tastes nicer if properly
cooked and served.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_146">No.&nbsp;146.</a>&mdash;French Beans.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pint tomato juice.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;shalot.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pound cooked French beans.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>A little pepper.</li>
<li>Thickening of flour and butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the shalot, and stew it in the tomato juice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82">82</a></span>for about half an <ins title="hour,">hour.</ins> Strain, add pepper and
salt, and thicken the juice with the flour and

<p>Boil the greens (Scotch kale, broccoli tops, etc.)
in the usual way. When quite tender, strain and
press well, place on a board and chop very finely;
dissolve the butter in a stewpan, place in the
greens, add a little pepper and more salt if required,
and stir briskly over the fire for two or three
minutes. Serve in a hot vegetable dish.</p>

<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the butter in a small stewpan, beat up
the eggs, add them to the butter, and stir over the
fire until the sauce thickens, but on no account
allow it to boil; add the greens, which should be
finely chopped (see <a href="#Recipe_147">No.&nbsp;147</a>), also seasoning if

<li>1&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the beans in the water for half an hour, add
salt, and boil again gently for another half or three-quarters
of an hour; strain away the liquor, and
leave the beans in the colander to dry off. Dissolve
the butter in a stewpan, gently toss the beans in it,
taking care not to break them, and serve.</p>

<p>Either chopped parsley, grated nutmeg, or lemon
juice may be added to the butter, but the beans
are extremely good quite plain.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;They may also be served in the liquor.

<h4><a name="Recipe_151">No.&nbsp;151.</a>&mdash;Green Peas Boiled.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pint shelled peas.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pint water.</li>
<li>A sprig of mint.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
<li>Â¼&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the peas, and place them in a stewpan with
the other ingredients, simmer with the lid off until
they are quite tender, remove the mint and serve.
The small quantity of liquor which remains will be
found useful for flavouring sauces, stews, etc.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;This way of cooking peas is greatly
superior to that of putting them into a large
quantity of water, as there is no waste and the
entire flavour and nutriment of the vegetable are
retained.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_152">No.&nbsp;152.</a>&mdash;Mashed Potatoes.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>Â½&nbsp;dozen large potatoes.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;ounce fresh butter.</li>
<li>3&nbsp;tablespoons milk.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>Â¼&nbsp;teaspoon pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash and scrub the potatoes until perfectly free
from dirt and mould, bake them, and when done
prick with a fork to allow the steam to escape, then
wipe with a cloth to remove any charred skin, etc.
Have ready a good-sized saucepan (enamelled for
preference) in which the milk and butter have been
heated, halve the potatoes and squeeze them into
it, add salt and pepper (the latter should be
omitted when being prepared for children), then
with a cook's fork beat backwards and forwards,
then round and round, until the whole mass is
perfectly smooth and quite free from lumps. Turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85">85</a></span>into a very hot vegetable dish, arrange in a pile
and mark prettily with a fork or knife, then place
in the oven for two or three minutes to re-heat.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Potatoes prepared in this way constitute
an ideal diet. All the valuable salts are retained
instead of being thrown away in the water, as when
peeled before cooking, whilst the butter and milk
supply the fatty elements in which the potato is
lacking. The colour also is good, which is not the
case when they are <em>boiled</em> in their skins, and the
taste is delicious.</p>

<p>Scrape the salsify, and throw it into cold water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86">86</a></span>cut into pieces about two inches long, and place
in an enamelled stewpan with the water, milk,
lemon, salt, and half an ounce of butter. Boil one

<p>Scald the tomatoes by pouring boiling water
over them, then place in cold water for half a
minute. Remove the skins, which will now come
off quite easily, slice the tomatoes into about four
pieces with a very sharp knife. Have ready a
stewpan in which the butter has been dissolved,
place the tomatoes in it, add the seasoning, and
stew gently for about twenty minutes, stirring
frequently.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;When strained, this constitutes a very
choice sauce, and it may be slightly thickened.</p>

</ul>

<p>Dissolve half an ounce of butter in a saucepan,
place in the beans and water, and boil one and a half
hours; add salt and boil another half hour. When
done, strain (saving the liquor), and turn the beans
into a basin containing half an ounce of oiled butter
and the nutmeg. Stir the beans about carefully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>and then place them in a dish or salad bowl; pour
the sauce over, and stand on one side to get
thoroughly cold.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_191">No.&nbsp;191.</a>&mdash;Onion Salad.</h4>

<li>Â½&nbsp;dozen peppercorns.</li>
<li><a href="#Recipe_176">Sauce No.&nbsp;176</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel and quarter the onions, and boil them in
salted water with the peppercorns and lemon peel.

<li>1&nbsp;tablespoon of chopped watercress.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;pint <a href="#Recipe_175">Sauce No.&nbsp;175</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The potatoes may either be boiled in their skins
or peeled; in the first way they will be the better
flavoured and more nourishing, in the latter a better
colour. They must be taken up carefully directly
they are tender, and not allowed to break up at all.
Cut into slices about half an inch thick, stamp out
into fancy shapes and arrange prettily in a small
bowl or dish; sprinkle them with the watercress,
which should have been thoroughly washed in
salted and rinsed in fresh water; then pour over the
sauce.</p>

<p>This salad, which is generally much appreciated,
will be found a very useful way of using up cold
potatoes.</p>

placing a cherry in the middle of each ring.
Pour the syrup over the top, when, if it be sufficiently
reduced, it will immediately set, and form a very
ornamental as well as delicious dish.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_217">No.&nbsp;217.</a>&mdash;Stewed French Plums.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pound French plums.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;or 8 lumps of sugar.</li>
<li>Water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the plums by placing them in a sieve or
strainer and pouring hot water over them; then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span>place them in a stewpan, cover with water, and boil
very gently for half an hour; drop in the sugar and
simmer for another half hour. When done, remove
the lid and stand the stewpan on one side for the
plums to cool. Pile them in a glass dish, and pour
the syrup over.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_218">No.&nbsp;218.</a>&mdash;Masked Pears.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>6&nbsp;stewing pears.</li>
<li>Â¾&nbsp;pint water.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;egg.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;tablespoons bread crumbs.</li>
<li>24&nbsp;lumps sugar.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;inch cinnamon stick.</li>
<li>Jam.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a syrup of the sugar and water, peel and
hollow the pears (which must remain whole), place
them in the syrup, and stew gently one hour or
until tender; lift them out very carefully on to a
plate and allow to cool. Fill them with jam, roll
in egg and bread crumbs, place in a buttered dish,
and bake for about twenty minutes. In the meantime,
place the cinnamon in the syrup and boil until
it is reduced, place the pears in a pretty dish, pour
the syrup over them through a strainer, and allow
to cool.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_219">No.&nbsp;219.</a>&mdash;Stewed Pears.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;dozen stewing pears.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;quart water.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;pound loaf sugar.</li>
<li>2&nbsp;inches cinnamon stick.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel the pears carefully and remove the cores,
but leave them whole. Dissolve the sugar in the
water, using an enamelled stewpan, place the pears
in this and allow to simmer for two hours, keeping
the lid on. Remove the stewpan from the fire, and
stand it on one side <em>without</em> the lid until the pears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116">116</a></span>are perfectly cold, then carefully lift them out (they
should be a beautiful red colour) into a glass dish.
Strain the syrup into a small stewpan, boil over a
good heat for about fifteen minutes (watching it
carefully the latter portion), reduce to three tablespoons,
pour over the pears, and allow to thoroughly
cool before serving.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_220">No.&nbsp;220.</a>&mdash;Early Rhubarb Stewed.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>5&nbsp;or 6 large sticks of rhubarb.</li>
<li>30&nbsp;lumps sugar.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;ounce butter.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;gill milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve the sugar in the milk, then add the butter
and rhubarb cut up. Stew gently over a moderate
heat until tender.</p>


<h4 class="new-h4"><a name="Recipe_221">No.&nbsp;221.</a>&mdash;Strawberries in Syrup.</h4>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1&nbsp;pound strawberries.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pound cherries.</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;pound loaf sugar.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;pint water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pound the cherries in a mortar, crushing as many
of the stones as possible. Place them with the water
and sugar in a stewpan, and boil one hour without
the lid. Strain the syrup into a small stewpan, and
reduce until it commences to thicken, then place in
the strawberries (first removing the stalks), and
shake them so that they become coated with the
syrup. Lift them out into a glass dish, reduce the
syrup again until it becomes quite thick, pour over
the strawberries, and allow to get quite cold.</p>
